# Tableau-Viz-DataScience-Jobs

**Tableau Visualization**

In addition to the Python script, I have also created a Tableau visualization using the same dataset.

Link to the script and the dataset - [Data-Science-Jobs-EDA](https://github.com/AayushDoshi/Data-Science-Jobs-EDA) repository.

The visualization provides an interactive and visual representation of the salary data, allowing for further exploration and analysis.

To access the Tableau visualization, please follow these steps:

Download and install Tableau Desktop or use Tableau Public.
Open Tableau and navigate to the "Connect" section.

Import the ds_salaries.csv file as a data source.

Once the data is loaded, you can explore various visualizations and dashboards that provide insights into the salary data.

The Tableau visualization was created by referring to an online tutorial, which helped in understanding the techniques and best practices for creating effective data visualizations. By leveraging Tableau's powerful features, the visualization offers a different perspective on the data and enhances the analysis.


If you have any questions or feedback regarding the Tableau visualization or the Python script, feel free to reach out.

Enjoy exploring the data!

Aayush Doshi.
